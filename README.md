## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Flutter SDK**: [Install Flutter](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) on your development machine.
- **Firebase Account**: Set up a [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) project for authentication and data storage.
- **The Things Network Account**: Access to [The Things Network](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/) for API integration.
- **Android/iOS Device or Emulator**: To run and test the application.

## Architecture

The app follows a **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** architecture, ensuring a clear separation of concerns:

- **Model**: Represents the data layer, including user data, power consumption records, and billing information.
- **View**: The UI components built using Flutter widgets, providing a responsive and interactive user interface.
- **Controller**: Handles the business logic, including API calls to The Things Network, data processing, and communication between the Model and View.

## Technologies Used

- **Flutter**: For cross-platform mobile app development.
- **Firebase**: For authentication and cloud storage.
- **LoRaWAN Technology**: For wireless communication with smart meter devices.
- **The Things Network API**: To access data from deployed devices.
- **Regression Algorithms**: For predictive analytics on power consumption and billing.
- **Figma**: For UI/UX design (Design files available upon request).
